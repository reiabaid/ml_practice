# Machine Learning – CampusX Practice Projects

## Overview

This repository contains my implementation of the projects and practice exercises from the **CampusX 100 Days of Machine Learning** series.

The objective of this journey is to:

- Build strong machine learning fundamentals  
- Implement concepts hands-on  
- Apply theory to real-world datasets  
- Develop industry-ready ML skills  

All code is written and practiced by me while following the series, with additional experimentation and improvements wherever possible.
